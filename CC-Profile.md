Hi! I'm Connor

I am interested in learning about machine learning and have been for quite some time. I find it really interesting how learning algorithms can sometimes pick up on patterns and trends that human researchers might not. 
I am not currently in a research group as I've shifted my focus more to industry and employment but my most recent research project was working with UF's MONSTER group to study metallic twins in magnesium specimens.
That was a project where I actually got to use machine learning tools and I learned a lot about the different mathematical models you can create to learn a trend. My hope with this class is to take that math knowledge
and translate it to computational knowledge. I usually tend to enjoy more artsy hobbies like writing or drawing, I enjoy the contrast between my hobbies and my technical school/work life.
